# The goal of this subjective experiment is to assess the similarities between cerebral bifurcations.

A reference bifurcation will be displayed on the upper part of the screen, and 5 different test versions will be displayed underneath.

Above each test version, a dropdown menu is used to sort the bifurcation with decreasing similarity.

i.e. a score of "1" means "strong similarity with the refrerence", whereas a score of "5" means "both bifurcations strongly differ".

# Protocol description:

The observers shall use the 5 dropdown menus to score the similarities, and then validate using the button located at the bottom of the page.

There are 24 successive displays being presented to the observers, the test duration is about 20 to 25 minutes.

# Controls :

    For each 3D display, the user can rotate the bifurcation using the left mouse button.
    It is also possible to zoom (in/out), using the scroll wheel.
    The display can also be shifted (by holding the 'SHIFT' key, while dragging the image).
